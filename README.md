## Applying NLP on News Headlines for Stock Market Prediction

The volatility of the stock market is hard to predict, but it is not impossible. By using a Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) based model that uses news article headlines to predict the movements in the stock market, we will be able to 
predict volatility. Our research aims to understand how to apply Computational Linguistics to perform sentiment analysis 
on news headlines to predict stock market movement in Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).
